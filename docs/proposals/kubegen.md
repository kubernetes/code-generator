# Kubernetes Code Generators

Kubernetes provides a collection of code generators to assist with developing APIs.  These code generators generate
useful libraries such as clients, openapi definitions, copying go structs, etc.

The `kubegen` uses directory structure conventions to detect Kubernetes APIs definitions and run the standard
set of Kubernetes code generators.

There are 2 methods for running kubegen

- Directly through the kubegen command line by downloading the binary and running at a the project root
- Through Bazel by adding rules to `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD.gazel`

## Kubernetes API conventions

kubegen will run the full set of Kubernetes code generators for all APIs it finds in the project.
kubegen looks for API groups defined under `pkg/apis/<group>/<version>` where *group* and *version* match the following
patterns.

- **group pattern**: ^[a-z]+$
- **version pattern**: ^v\\d+(alpha\\d+|beta\\d+)*$

By default, kubegen will run code generators for both external types defined under `pkg/apis/<group>/<version>` and
internal types defined under `pkg/apis/<group>`.  The location kubegen searches can be overridden.

kubegen will prepend all generated files with copyright and license comments.

By default, the kubegen binary runs all* of the Kubernetes code
generators against all API group/versions defined in the project.

**List of generators:*

- client-gen
- conversion-gen
- deepcopy-gen
- defaulter-gen
- go-to-protobuf
- informer-gen
- lister-gen
- openapi-gen
- set-gen

## Running via Command line

### Installing the command line

- Download the latest kubegen release from the code-generators release page.
- Extract the tar and add the `kubegen` binary to the PATH
- Run `kubegen version` to list the version
  - Will correspond to a Kubernetes release

### Running the command line

#### Use defaults

```sh
kubegen
```

- run all code generators against discovered APIs
  - run for both internal and external types
- prepend license to generated files
  - wrap the contents of the LICENSE in comments
  - exit non-zero if the LICENSE file is missing

#### Specifying copyright owners

The copyright owners for the license can be defined with the `--copyright` flag

```sh
kubegen --copyright "The Kubernetes Authors."
```

- run all code generators against discovered APIs
  - run for both internal and external types
- prepend license to generated files
  - wrap the contents of the LICENSE in comments
  - start license with "Copyright <current year> <copyright>" e.g. *Copyright 2018 The Kubernetes Authors.*
  - exit non-zero if the LICENSE file is missing


#### Specifying the license file

The license file can be overridden from the LICENSE file using the `--license-file` flag

```sh
kubegen --license-file "boilerplate.go.txt"
```

- run all code generators against discovered APIs
  - run for both internal and external types
- prepend license to generated files
  - use the contents from boilerplate.go.txt
  - if boilerplate.go.txt is already in comments then use it verbatim, otherwise wrap it in comments
  - exit non-zero if boilerplate.go.txt is missing

#### Specifying a license type

The license can be overridden from the LICENSE file using the `--license` flag

```sh
kubegen --license "Apache 2.0"
```

- run all code generators against discovered APIs
  - run for both internal and external types
- prepend license to generated files
  - use an *Apache 2.0* license
  
#### Generating for external types only

Generating code for internal types can be skipped using the `generate-internal` flag

```sh
kubegen --generate-internal=false
```

- run all code generators against discovered APIs
  - run for external types only
- prepend license to generated files
  - wrap the contents of the LICENSE in comments
  - exit non-zero if the LICENSE file is missing

#### Specifying API versions

Generating code only for specific API group versions can be performed by providing the API
group versions as positional arguments.

```sh
kubegen apps/v1 apps/v1beta1 extensions/v1beta1
```

- run all code generators against the apps/v1 apps/v1beta1 extensions/v1beta1 API groups versions
  - run for both internal and external types
- prepend license to generated files
  - wrap the contents of the LICENSE in comments
  - exit non-zero if the LICENSE file is missing

#### Specifying generators

Generating code using only a specific set of generators can be performed using the
`--generator` flag.  This flag may be provided multiple times to run multiple
generators.

```sh
kubegen --generator client-gen --generator lister-gen
```

- run only the client-gen and lister-gen code generators
  - run for both internal and external types
- prepend license to generated files
  - wrap the contents of the LICENSE in comments
  - exit non-zero if the LICENSE file is missing
  
#### Specifying where to search for APIs

Looking for APIs outside the default location can be configured using
the `--apis-dir` flag.  This flag may be provided multiple times to search multiple
directories.

```sh
kubegen --apis-dir notpkg/apis --apis-dir pkg/notapis
```

- run all code generators against discovered APIs
  - search for API group versions under notpkg/apis and pkg/notapis instead of pkg/apis  

## Running via Bazel

### Installing via bazel

Add the following to the project *WORKSPACE* file

```py
http_archive(
    name = "io_k8s_rules_go",
    url = "https://github.com/kubernetes/bazelbuild/releases/download/v1.8.0/rules_go-1.8.0.tar.gz",
    sha256 = "<number>",
)
```

Add the following to the project root *BUILD.bazel* file

```py
load("@io_k8s_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "code-generator")

kubegen(
    name = "kubegen",
)
```

### Running the Bazel target

```sh
bazel run //:kubegen
```

### Bazel options

- *license*: same behavior as *license* flag for cli
- *license-file*: same behavior as *license-file* flag for cli
- *copyright*: same behavior as *copyright* flag for cli

## FAQ

> How does kubegen invoke the other code generators without me having to download them?

kubegen statically compiles the logic for all code generators

> How can Kubernetes APIs be provided as inputs to the code generators for things like generating openapi

kubegen will include any vendored API groups found under `vendor/k8s.io/api/`
